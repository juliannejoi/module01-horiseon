# module01-horiseon

In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired us to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

## USER STORY

AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

*GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards

*WHEN I view the source code
 THEN I find semantic HTML elements

*WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
 THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

*WHEN I view the image elements
 THEN I find accessible alt attributes

*WHEN I view the heading attributes
 THEN they fall in sequential order

*WHEN I view the title element
 THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

 ## ðŸ’¡ Hints

* Refer to 
[HTML Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

* Update non=semantic elements to semantic elements in index.html

* Update code in style.css to match code changes in index.html

* Combine repeating code for multiple nodes in style.css by using comma

* Ensure nav links on header are operating as expected
